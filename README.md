# 🌍 3D Solar System Simulation – Frontend Assignment

This project is a fully interactive **3D simulation of the solar system**, created as part of a **frontend developer assignment**. It includes all 8 planets orbiting around the Sun, realistic textures, orbital motion, background stars, user controls, and a mobile-friendly UI — all built with **Three.js** and **pure HTML/CSS/JS**, with **no CSS animations or frameworks** used.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Project Description

The objective of this assignment is to build a responsive and browser-based solar system simulation using Three.js to showcase skills in:

- 3D scene creation and rendering
- Camera and lighting setup
- Planetary motion and animation
- User interactivity with the DOM
- Mobile responsiveness and design logic

This simulation is coded entirely in **vanilla JavaScript** and uses `requestAnimationFrame()` and `THREE.Clock()` for smooth animations.

## 🌟 Features

✅ Real-time 3D solar system with 8 orbiting planets  
✅ Realistic planet textures and rotation speeds  
✅ Slider-based control panel to adjust individual planet speeds  
✅ Dark mode and light mode toggle  
✅ Pause and Resume animation  
✅ Tooltip with planet names on hover  
✅ Saturn and Uranus rings  
✅ Starfield background for outer space look  
✅ Fully mobile responsive layout  
✅ 100% plain JavaScript and Three.js — no CSS animations or external JS frameworks

## 🪐 Planets Included

1. Mercury  
2. Venus  
3. Earth  
4. Mars  
5. Jupiter  
6. Saturn (with ring)  
7. Uranus (with ring)

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

This project is **fully mobile compatible**:

- Responsive control panel layout
- Supports touch gestures via `OrbitControls`
- Works on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox mobile
- Resizes dynamically on smaller devices

---

## 🎮 Controls

| Element         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Pause**       | Toggles all planetary motion |
| **Reset Speeds**| Resets all planets to their default orbital speeds |
| **Light Theme** | Switch between dark and light mode |
| **Sliders**     | Adjust each planet's orbit speed |
| **Tooltip**     | Shows planet name on mouse hover or touch focus |

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Creating and managing a 3D scene with **Three.js**
- Handling camera, lights, materials, meshes
- Using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth looping animation
- Manipulating the DOM for real-time interaction
- Applying basic UI/UX for a functional, responsive control panel

---

## 🎥 Demo Video Suggestions

If you're submitting this for review or a job assignment, include a **2–3 minute screen recording** showing:

1. The solar system rotating in motion  
2. Speed sliders affecting planet orbits in real-time  
3. Theme toggling between light and dark  
4. Pause/resume animation  
5. Folder structure and code walkthrough

---

## 💡 Optional Improvements

Want to go beyond the assignment? Here are some ideas:

- Add dwarf planet Pluto  
- Add orbit trails using lines or transparent rings  
- Add moons (like Earth's moon or Jupiter's Ganymede)  
- Add click-to-zoom feature for each planet  
- Add real data-based orbital distances and scale

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Three.js** – 3D rendering and animation
- **HTML5 Canvas** – Rendering context
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Logic, interaction, and animation
- **No CSS animations** were used
